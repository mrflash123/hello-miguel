<h1>About Miguel:</h1
<p>im a cool individual that loves to learn new things. Video games, anime and food is the best things in the whole world.I'm very layed back and like to chill out most of the time.</p> 
<p>i rather stay indoors than go out 90% of the time beause i'm a home body.But, when i do its usually to a park or something because i like nature.</p> 
<p>I get along with a lot of people but, i really don't talk to that much people. I'm very quite at first all the time. But i start to open up more when i get comfortable.
